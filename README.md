            This 1-week project is powered by Ruby on Rails (API), ReactJS, and Semantic UI. This was a partner-project with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-youngdale-508562112/">Ryan Youngdale</a> as we were learning ReactJS.
            </p>
            <p>The concept-board for this project includes one thing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Apple iPhone's built-in weather application</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                A weather application that utilizes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.metaweather.com/api/">MetaWeather API</a> to showcase 5-day forecasts. API calls to MetaWeather are done through a Rails API application, and memoization is employed therein to minimize calls to MetaWeather. A simple (non-secure) login system is employed to allow users to manage favorite cities, allowing the addition and removal of cities from "My Cities". Finally, the Zomato API was utilized to give users some extra information: best restaurants in the city whose weather is being looked at.
